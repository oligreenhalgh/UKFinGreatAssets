    "overview": "The investment thesis recommends deploying \u00a37.50 million into a portfolio-acquisition strategy focused on diversified pools of senior, short-duration SME credit exposures. The objective is to dilute current leverage, stabilize cash generation, and improve debt service capacity by acquiring high-cash-pay, self-liquidating assets. This strategy includes a dedicated 30% allocation to Life Science SME debt portfolios and 70% to diversified SME credit portfolios, targeting a 7-9% net cash yield.",
    "kpis": [
      "Net cash yield: 7\u20139% at steady state",
      "Collection efficiency: >95% of expected collections (receivables pools)",
      "30+ day delinquency ratio: maintained below agreed pool thresholds (set per asset type)",
      "Annualized net loss rate: <3% core sleeve; <5% Life Science sleeve",
      "Recovery rate on defaults: >75% core sleeve; >70% Life Science sleeve",
      "Concentration: top 10 obligors <15% of any pool; single sector <20% (unless explicitly approved)",
      "Portfolio debt service coverage improvement quarter-on-quarter",
      "Look-through LTV reduction of 5\u20138 pts over 18\u201324 months",
      "Principal returned (collections/amortization) as % of invested capital: 25\u201335% by end of year two (depending on pool mix)"
